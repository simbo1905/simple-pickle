/// Compatibility mode. Set via system property `no.framework.Pickler.Compatibility`. The default is DISABLED.
/// **Record Types** If set to DISABLED (our default) the pickler will during deserialization of `records`:
/// - verify 8-bytes of a sha256 hash of class simple nane as well as components full generic types and name.
/// - verify the length of the `record` class matches the number of components. // TODO this is unnecessary due to the hash check.
/// If set to DEFAULTED (the opt-in), the pickler will:
/// - defaults missing component fields to null for reference types and default values for primitives (e.g., 0 for int).
/// - bypass the hash check
/// This allows for renaming of fields but not reordering.
///
/// **Enum Types** If set to DISABLED (our default) the pickler will during deserialization of `enums`:
/// - verify 8-bytes of a sha256 hash of class simple name as well as enum constant names
/// If set to DEFAULTED (the opt-in), the pickler will:
/// - bypass the hash check
///
/// In contrast, JDK deserialization using ObjectInputStream:
///  - defaults missing component fields in the wire. Reference types are null, primitives use default values (e.g., 0 for int).
///  - writes out the class name, component names, and types onto the wire.
/// This allows for reordering of fields but not renaming.

  DISABLED,

  /// Lenient mode: Allows missing fields (uses defaults) but does not permit field reordering.
  /// More permissive than DISABLED but differs from JDK behavior by disallowing reordering.
